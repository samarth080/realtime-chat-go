## 🧱 Database Design

All database tables are **normalized up to 3NF**, ensuring:
- ✅ Atomic, consistent data
- ✅ No redundancy or transitive dependencies
- ✅ Clean relational structure with foreign keys

> The schema supports core entities: `users`, `userChats`, `messages`, `read_receipts`, `groups`, `group_members`, `group_messages`, and `group_read_receipts`.

## ⚙️ Project Workflow

### 1. **User Registration**
- Endpoint: `register`
- Stores new users in the DB with unique usernames

### 2. **Direct Messaging**
- Send/receive messages
- Mark messages as read
- View message history
- Delete messages securely

### 3. **Group Messaging**
- Create and manage groups
- Send/receive group messages
- View who read each group message
- Group-based message deletion by sender/admin

## 🧪 Testing & Results

- All routes tested with valid and invalid inputs
- Real-time read receipts and message tracking work as expected
- Group permissions (admin, member) correctly enforced
- Secure error handling with clear, consistent responses
